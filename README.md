Explorie’s mission is to be an NFT platform with real-life utilities. It seeks to encourage exploration and adventure. Users can download the Explorie app and venture outside their doors. Collectable geo-tagged NFTs will be available around the neighbourhood, which players can redeem. These NFTs can be in the form of vouchers from retail businesses such as restaurants, stores and theme parks, collectables such as limited edition digital pets as well as digital art. This can also promote health and wellness through NFT gamification.
